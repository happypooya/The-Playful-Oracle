How The Playful Oracle Works
This app helps you choose a board game from your collection based on your preferences and play history. Here's how:

Game Library: Add all your board games to the library below. You can include their name, importance (priority), duration, and your personal score.
Filtering: Use the "Filter by Duration" dropdown to narrow down suggestions based on how long you want to play.
Suggestions: Click "Propose 3 Games" and the Oracle will suggest up to three games from your library that haven't been played recently (based on the Chronicle) and match your filter. Games with higher importance are more likely to be suggested.
Chronicle of Plays: When you play a suggested game (or manually record one), it's added to your Chronicle with the date. This helps the Oracle know which games haven't been played recently.
Manual Recording: You can manually add a game to your Chronicle if you played it outside of the suggestions.
Editing & Deleting: You can edit or remove games directly from the Game Library table.
Undo: The "Undo Last Play" button lets you quickly remove the most recent entry from your Chronicle if you made a mistake.
The goal is to help you explore your entire game collection and rediscover forgotten favorites!
